This python3 library provides classes for tight-binding calculations with Wannier Hamiltonians, but can easily applied to general user-defined tight-binding Hamiltonians. The object oriented usage allows for 

## Capabilities
* Calculation of the following expectation values:
    + Polarization calculation of operators _L,S,J_
    + Expectation value calculation of self-defined k-independent operators 
    + Berry curvature and orbital moment of Bloch state
    + Band inversion character
* Winding number/Pontryagin index of 3D expectation values
* Wannier charge center movement
* _H(k)_ Fouriertransformation for w2dynamics input
* ...


## Required python modules
* numpy
* time
